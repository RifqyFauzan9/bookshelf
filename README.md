# Bookshelf App Project

This is the bookshelf project web, where it's able to create, move and delete books from one table to another. And also save all books to local storage.

## Features

This project focuses on a simple yet complete bookshelf management experience.

- Add books with title, author, release year, and completion status.
- Move books between the “Belum selesai dibaca” and “Selesai dibaca” shelves via action buttons.
- Delete books when they’re no longer needed.
- Persist every change using `localStorage`, so data survives page reloads.
- Search across title, author, or year using the search box.
- Show a short toast notification whenever a book is added, moved, or deleted.
